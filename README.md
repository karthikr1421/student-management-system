# 🎓 Student Data Management System (C++ Console Project)

This is a simple console-based **Student Data Management System** built using C++ and basic file handling.  
The project was created as part of my C++ learning journey to apply what I’ve learned about `struct`, file I/O, string handling, and problem-solving in a real-world scenario.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new student records  
- ✅ Display all student records  
- ✅ Search student by registration number  
- ✅ Update existing student details  
- ✅ Delete student records  
- ✅ Input validation (names, numbers, CGPA)  
- ✅ Colored terminal output using ANSI codes

## 🛠 Technologies and Concepts Used

- C++  
- Structs and file handling (`fstream`)  
- String manipulation (`getline`, `stringstream`, `stoi`)  
- Basic STL usage (`all_of`, `isalpha`, `isspace`)  
- ANSI escape codes for terminal coloring  
- Logical flow using flags, validation checks, and error handling

📘 Learning Log
I’ve documented my development process and learnings in progress_log.md, covering bugs faced, how I solved them, and how my understanding evolved from day to day.

✍️ Reflections
This was my first real-world project using file handling in C++.
At the beginning, I was unfamiliar with many concepts like validation, parsing strings, file rewrites, and terminal formatting.
Through building this system, I:

Understood how to break a problem into small steps

Learned debugging and self-research

Gained confidence in writing working code from scratch

Learned to think like a developer, not just a learner

🙋‍♂️ About Me
I’m a BTech student currently learning C++ and preparing for Software Development roles.
This project reflects my growth as a beginner developer and my commitment to learning by doing.
